**IoT&B** is a R&D project made by *BlockchainLab Srl* and the *Blockchain research group* at *Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Calabria*. 

* Details about the IoT&B project are available at: https://www.iot-blockchain.it/  
* Details about the IoT&Unicalcoin prototype will be published soon.

Here're available the code snippets used to connect IoT devices prototypes (Raspberry Pi) to the Unicalcoin blockchain (Ethereum), including:

 * **Ballot.sol** is a shorted version of the Smart Contract used for prototype demo
 * **blockchain-to-iot.js** contain the JS functions used into the Node-RED program that connect the Blockchain to the IoT actuator
 * **iot-to-blockchain.js** contain the JS functions used into the Node-RED program that connect the IoT sensor to the Blockchain
